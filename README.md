#What is it?

Guild Status allows you to pull league results for a collection of accounts (either auto grabbed by Guild using it's ID or manual input list). It searches a custom API provided by [/u/trackpete](http://www.reddit.com/user/trackpete) to grab the current lader standings of each account and display them in a searchable grid view. Additionally you can export to an Excel spreadsheet to allow some advanced reporting to be done.

#Usage

Enter your guild ID (obtainable by clicking on your guild from your profile on pathofexile and noting the number at the end of the web url) and press enter to fetch your guilds members. Alternatively switch to the 'Accounts' tab and enter 1 account per line. Enter a supported league (omrtb/omrtbhc/Standard/Hardcore/Bloodlines/Torment) and hit search.
